# PRSE
A programming language for C programmers, without all the hassle of C.

Design goals:
* Make a language that works a lot like C/C++, but with some additional built-in features
* Use clean, straightforward grammar
* Don't use syntactic whitespace. Who puts <i>that</i> in a programming language?
* Take up little of the programmer's time. If R can do vectorization, we can too.
