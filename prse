prse

.SH DESCRIPTION
The PRSE compiler translates provided .prse code to C++, then compiles that to a binary, unless the user provides arguments to the compiler to specify that it should do something else [see OPTIONS]

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -h
display help text, which lists a few of the below arguments
.IP -cpp
compile to .cpp files instead of to a binary, unless -o is used to specify the output directory
.IP -c
compile to a .o file for use with a Makefile, ar for creating libraries, or some other need
.IP -g
retain source-level debugging/symbol information while compiling. If you are well-versed in C++, you can use this along with a separate 'prse -cpp [files]' command to debug your program
.IP -lib [path]
